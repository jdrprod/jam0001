# Introduction

Commenting the code is good practice,
but no one ever said that coding the comments is good practice.
In our programming language *KerLang*,
the compiler/interpreter does it for the programmer,
thus reducing the boiler plate code that merely parahases the comments.

# What is comment-oriented programming ?

COP (Comment-Oriented Programming) is a programming paradigm that relies on
the fact that programmers shouln't be trusted at the task of implementing
comments into code.
Insted of relying of first-class code,
the language relies on first-class comments that describes what to do
to some extent.
